# Family Event Organiser
This is some starter code for the FEWD coursework. It consists of a simple family organiser application. Users can register, log in and add family members. The person who registers for the family initially has elavated permissions. Users can add events and can edit and delete events that they have created.

In addition to the working application there are two JSON endpoints. These display the contents of the user database and the events database. These would not usually be part of a finalised version of the application but are provided as they may  be helpful in the development of the React application required for the coursework. 

You are free to use and modify this code as you chose when working on your coursework. You may also choose to ignore it and develop your own code.
